3. Click the "Start Game" button.
4. Player 1 starts with 'X', and Player 2 follows with 'O'.
5. Click on an empty box to make a move.
6. The game automatically detects a win or draw and updates the score accordingly.
7. The game board resets after a short delay following a win or draw.

## Game Rules
- Players take turns placing their marks ('X' or 'O') on the 3x3 grid.
